# Hi

We are S.T.R.I.K.E. (Strategic Technology & Robotics Intelligence Kinetic Engineers) Aerospace sector. Well the name is quite funny, maybe you think that we make rockets or something like this. Actually we are part of, we made "Can-Sats". 

This team was formed because of a school competition, specifically, a CanSat competition in the Autonomous Metropolitan University (UAM, according to its Spanish acronym). 

Maybe you reading this, think : "Ok, so were are our project". Well... we haven't finish, today August 26. In the next days you will see a development in process, just thruth in the process.

thank you for reading this :p

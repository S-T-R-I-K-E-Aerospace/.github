# Hi

We are S.T.R.I.K.E. (Strategic Technology & Robotics Intelligence Kinetic Engineers) from the Aerospace sector. The name might sound a bit funnyâ€”you might think we build rockets or something like that. Actually, we specialize in something a bit smaller: we build "CanSats."

Our team was formed for a school competition, specifically the CanSat competition at the Autonomous Metropolitan University (UAM, for its acronym in Spanish).

If you're reading this and thinking, "Okay, so where's your project?" Well... we haven't finished it yet. Today is August 26th. In the coming days, you'll see our development process unfold. Just truth in the process.

thank you for reading this :p
